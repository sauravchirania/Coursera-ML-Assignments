# Coursera-ML-Assignments
These are my solutions to the programming assignments of Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
Each folder has a sub-folder which consists OCTAVE codes and a pdf which contains the problem statement.
I have solved every problem in the course, including the optional exercises.
